## Wastage Recording Format

For each entry, include:

- **Wastage (in KG)**
- **Roll No**
- **Time**
- **Doff Number**

---

# Important Notes

1. Only defects visible to the camera can be detected.
2. For cross-checking:
   - The machine number and roll number must be written on the roll using a permanent marker.
   - Marking must be done immediately before each roll starts and at the end of the roll.
3. There must be no cloth folds on the fabric.
4. The camera angle must not be changed.
5. Do not exit the UI screen on the tablet without instructions from the Knit-I Team.
