# Accuracy Points – Camera & Light Alignment

---

# 1. Camera Lens Position Marking

### Pain Point
The lens focus and aperture frequently change during cleaning or maintenance, reducing image clarity and defect detection accuracy.

### Implementation

To prevent this:

- Place a **reference marking** at the exact point where the camera lens is fixed.
- Draw a **clear line from the aperture area up to the focus screw region**.
- Ensure the marking is permanent and clearly visible.

### Benefit

These markings ensure that after any cleaning, maintenance, or reinstallation:

- Lens alignment remains consistent  
- Focus accuracy is preserved  
- Image clarity is maintained  
- Defect detection accuracy remains stable

## 2. Camera Mounting Alignment

### Pain Point
Servicing or external factors may alter the camera angle, leading to changes in the fixed fabric angle and causing potential false alarms.

### Implementation

- Draw **position markings on the camera mounting clamps**.
- Indicate the **exact fixed position** of the camera.
- Verify and maintain both **angle and height alignment**.
- Use a **permanent, highly visible marker** that is not easily erasable.

## 3. Light Mounting Alignment

### Pain Point
Servicing or external factors may alter the light angle, leading to changes in light luminosity and causing potential false alarms.

### Implementation

- Draw **position markings on the light mounting clamps**.
- Indicate the **exact fixed position** of the light.
- Ensure the original **light angle and height** are maintained.
- Use a **permanent, visible marker** to prevent fading or removal.

## 4. Purpose

- Prevent misalignment after maintenance or vibration  
- Maintain consistent image capture and calibration accuracy  
- Minimize the need for frequent re-focusing or manual adjustment  
- Reduce false alarms caused by hardware movement  

---

## 5. Responsibility

The **Service Engineer** is responsible for:

- Making alignment markings during installation  
- Verifying markings after every maintenance activity  
- Ensuring markings remain visible and intact  
- Confirming correct alignment before system handover  

---

## 6. Troubleshooting

With proper markings in place:

- Lens focus adjustments become faster  
- Camera misalignment can be quickly identified  
- Light angle shifts are easier to correct  
- Customer-side technicians can resolve issues using clear reference points  
- Overall downtime is reduced
