# Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)  
## Creating Defects in Circular Knitting Machine – Single Jersey

---

## Scope
This procedure applies to the creation of defects in single jersey fabric using a circular knitting machine.  
It is intended for use by qualified personnel who have received proper training.

---

## Responsibilities
- **Operator / Machine Technician**  
  Responsible for creating defects according to this SOP.
- **Quality Control (QC) Personnel**  
  Responsible for verifying defects and ensuring data accuracy.
- **Mill Personnel**  
  Responsible for providing prior permission and oversight.

---

## Procedure

### 1. Preparation
- **New Roll Number**: Ensure a new roll number is created in the system before starting defect creation.
- **Permission**: Obtain prior permission from mill personnel.
- **Machine Check**: Ensure the circular knitting machine is in proper working condition.

---

### 2. Creating Lycra Cut Defect
- Create **5–10 lycra cut defects**.
- Ensure defects are evenly distributed and clearly visible across the fabric.

---

### 3. Creating Holes
Create holes in the fabric as per the following specifications:

| Hole No | Size |
|------|------|
| 1 | 0.5 mm |
| 2 | 1 mm |
| 3 | 1.5 mm |
| 4 | 2 mm |
| 5 | 5 mm |
| 6 | 1 cm |
| 7 | 1.5 cm |
| 8 | 5 cm |

- Ensure holes are created **at least 8 times** in **4 different angles** with varying diameters.

---

### 4. Creating Lycra Jump (Lycra Dash)
- Create lycra jump defects.
- Ensure defects are visible in **at least 30 images**.
- Verify even distribution of defects.

---

### 5. Creating Shut Off Defect (Press Off)
- Create a **minimum of 1 doff** with shut-off defects.
- Ensure the defect is clearly visible and documented.

---

### 6. Creating Two-Ply Defect
- Create two-ply defects in **5–10 doffs**.
- Ensure defects are clearly evident and documented.

---

### 7. Creating 7 Needle Line Defect  
*(Both Cylinder & Dial – for Double Jersey)*

- Create **7 needle lines** on the fabric:
  - **Longer sides**: 2 needle lines on each side
  - **Shorter sides**: 1 needle line on each side

---

## Data Collection

### 8. Data Collection with Needle Drop
- Identify the needle drop point.
- Measure distances of **1 cm, 2 cm, 5 cm, and 8 cm** on **both sides** of the needle drop.
- Create needle line defects near the needle drop for all distances **at the same time**.
- For each defect created in **15–20 doffs**, record measurements and observations.

---

### 9. Data Collection with Selvedge
- Identify the selvedge.
- Create needle lines on **both sides** of the selvedge.
- Measure distances of **1 cm, 2 cm, 5 cm, and 8 cm** from the selvedge on both sides.
- Create needle line defects for all distances.
- For **15–20 doffs**, record measurements and observations.

---

### 10. Creating IRO Line / Belt Line
- Create an IRO or belt line defect.
- Observe and collect defect data.
- Ensure accurate and comprehensive documentation.

---

### 11. Double Edge Needle Line  
*(Fabric Coverage Validation)*

- Used to validate fabric coverage for camera setup.
- Measure camera coverage using a measuring tape.
- Based on coverage:
  - Create **1 needle line** at the left end of the camera angle.
  - Create **1 needle line** at the right end.
- In the rotation image, **both needle lines must appear in a single image**.

---

## Data Management
- **Data Backup**: Copy all defect-related data to a hard disk immediately.
- **Data Upload**: Upload all data and images to **OneDrive**.
- **Documentation**: Ensure data is properly labeled and organized for easy retrieval.

---

## Reporting and Review
- Review all created defects with QC personnel.
- Verify documentation completeness and accuracy.
- Report anomalies or issues to the supervisor.

---

## Safety Considerations
- Follow all safety protocols while operating the circular knitting machine.
