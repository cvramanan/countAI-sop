# Data Creation SOP

---

## Scope

This procedure applies to the creation of defects in single jersey fabric using a circular knitting machine.  
It is intended for use by qualified personnel who have received proper training.

---

## Responsibilities

- **Operator / Machine Technician**
  - Responsible for creating defects according to the SOP.

- **Quality Control (QC) Personnel**
  - Responsible for verifying the defects and ensuring data accuracy.

- **Mill Personnel**
  - Responsible for providing prior permission and oversight.

---

# Procedure

---

## 1. Preparation

- **New Roll Number**
  - Ensure a new roll number is created in the system before starting defect creation.

- **Defect Mapping**
  - For each defect, note the start and stop revolution where the defect is present.
  - Inform the validation team.

- **Defect Visibility**
  - Ensure the defect is clearly visible while creating the data.
  - If any defect is subtly visible, inform the validation team.

- **Permission**
  - Obtain prior permission from mill personnel before starting defect creation.

- **Machine Check**
  - Ensure the circular knitting machine is in proper working condition.

- **Defect Creation Objective**
  - **500 GT images per defect (Compulsory)**

- **Instructions**
  - Bypass the machine and collect data by jogging the machine.
  - Save images as instructed.
  - Defect must appear in different positions/angles.
  - Similar defect positions in images are strictly avoided.

# Defect Creation Guidelines

---

## 2. Creating Lycra Cut Defect

- Create **5 to 10** lycra cut defects.
- Ensure defects are evenly distributed.
- Ensure defects are clearly visible across the fabric.

---

## 3. Creating Holes

Create holes in the following sizes:

| Hole No | Size |
|----------|------|
| Hole 1   | 0.5 mm |
| Hole 2   | 1 mm |
| Hole 3   | 1.5 mm |
| Hole 4   | 2 mm |
| Hole 5   | 5 mm |
| Hole 6   | 1 cm |
| Hole 7   | 1.5 cm |
| Hole 8   | 5 cm |

- Each hole size must be placed **at least 8 times**
- Use **4 different angles**
- Ensure varying diameters are clearly visible

---

## 4. Creating Lycra Jump (Lycra Dash)

- Create lycra jump defects.
- Ensure defects are visible in **at least 30 images**.
- Verify even distribution across the fabric.

---

## 5. Creating Shut Off Defect (Press Off)

- Create a minimum of **1 doff** with shut-off defects.
- Ensure defect is clearly visible and documented.

---

## 6. Creating Two-Ply Defect

- Create defects in **5 to 10 doffs**.
- Ensure defects are clearly evident and documented.

---

## 7. Creating 7 Needle Line Defect  
*(Both Cylinder & Dial – For Double Jersey)*

Create 7 needle lines as follows:

- **Longer Sides**
  - 2 needle lines on each longer side

- **Shorter Sides**
  - 1 needle line on each shorter side

---

# Data Collection Procedures

---

## 8. Data Collection With Needle Drop

- Identify the needle drop point.
- Measure distances:
  - 1 cm
  - 2 cm
  - 5 cm
  - 8 cm  
  *(On both sides of the needle drop)*

- Create a needle line defect near the needle drop at all distances.
- This must be done simultaneously.
- For each defect created in **15 to 20 doffs**, record:
  - Measurements
  - Observations

---

## 9. Data Collection With Selvedge

- Identify the selvedge.
- Create needle lines on both sides of the selvedge.
- Measure distances:
  - 1 cm
  - 2 cm
  - 5 cm
  - 8 cm  
  *(On both sides)*

- Create needle line defects at all distances.
- For each **15 to 20 doffs**, record:
  - Measurements
  - Observations

---

## 10. Creating IRO Line or Belt Line

- Create an IRO line or belt line defect.
- Observe the defect carefully.
- Collect comprehensive and accurate data.

---

## 11. Double Edge Needle Line (Fabric Coverage Check)

Purpose: To check fabric coverage on the camera setup.

- Measure the camera coverage area using a measuring tape.
- According to the measurement:
  - Create **1 needle line** at the left end of camera angle.
  - Create **1 needle line** at the right end.
- During rotation image observation:
  - Both needle lines must appear in a single image.

---

# Data Management

---

## Data Backup

- Immediately copy all defect-related data to a hard disk.

## Data Upload

- Upload collected data and images to **OneDrive**.

## Documentation

- Ensure:
  - Proper labeling
  - Organized storage
  - Easy retrieval

---

# Reporting and Review

- Review all created defects with QC personnel.
- Ensure proper documentation and storage.
- Report any anomalies or issues to the supervisor immediately.

---

# Safety Considerations

- Follow all safety protocols while operating the knitting machine.
- Ensure proper PPE usage.
- Never bypass safety mechanisms without authorization.
