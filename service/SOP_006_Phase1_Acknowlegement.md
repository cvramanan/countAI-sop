# INSTRUCTIONS – FOLLOW STEP BY STEP

## Step 1: Verify Machine & Fabric Details

Before starting validation:

1. Confirm the knitting machine brand and machine number.
2. Confirm fabric type under production.
3. Record the details accurately in this document.
4. Ensure production is running under normal operating conditions.

> Do not proceed without recording correct machine and fabric details.

---

## Step 2: Create & Observe Defect Detection

During live production:

1. Intentionally create the below defects on the knitting machine (under controlled supervision).
2. Monitor the KNIT-I system screen continuously.
3. Check whether the system:
   - Detects the defect in real time
   - Captures the defect image
   - Displays alert notification
   - Records the defect in the system log


---

## Step 3: Cross-Check Fabric Physically

For every detected defect:

1. Stop the fabric at the indicated defect position.
2. Physically inspect the fabric.
3. Confirm the presence of the defect.
4. Compare the physical defect with the system-captured image.
5. If both match → Mark status as **Verified**.
6. If mismatch → Report to Validation and re-test.

> No defect should be marked as verified without physical confirmation.

## Step 4: Defect Validation Table

Client must verify detection of the following defects:

| S.No | Defect Name  | Action to Take | Status (Verified / Not Verified) | Sign |
|------|-------------|----------------|-----------------------------------|------|
| 1 | Needleline | Confirm detection & physical match | | |
| 2 | Lycra Cut | Confirm detection & physical match | | |
| 3 | Lycra Jump | Confirm detection & physical match | | |
| 4 | Hole | Confirm detection & physical match | | |
| 5 | Pressoff | Confirm detection & physical match | | |
| 6 | Double Yarn | Confirm detection & physical match | | |

✔ Mark **"Verified"** only if defect is correctly captured and physically confirmed.  
✔ If any defect is not detected, do not sign until corrective action is completed.

## Step 5: Final Review Before Signing

Before providing signature, ensure:

- All listed defects were tested  
- All verified defects are physically confirmed  
- Detection accuracy is satisfactory  
- Production flow remained uninterrupted  
- System calibration and optimization are completed  

> Do NOT sign without full verification.

- Phase 1 installation has been successfully completed.
- Defect detection has been verified under live production conditions.
- The above defects are accurately identified and captured.
- The system operates without operational disruption.
- Performance is satisfactory at the time of validation.
