# Supervisor’s SOP  
## Program Information – Knit-I

---

# 1. Cross Verification

- Check the **Program Information (Knit-I)** daily with the **Efficiency Report**.
- Ensure both reports match exactly.
- Any mismatch must be corrected immediately.

# 2. Prompt Update with Knit-I

- Program information must be updated **promptly** whenever there is a program change.
- Always verify with the **Program Availability Document** before updating.

# 3. Updating the Right Information

⚠️ Update Program Info **only as per the training provided**.

Be extremely careful while selecting the following 4 critical parameters:

1. **Knit Type**
2. **Fabric Type**
3. **Lycra** (Yes / No)
4. **Needle Drop** (Yes / No)

These four parameters directly impact **Knit-I performance**.
