# 1. Purpose

To define a standardized process for identification, analysis, and resolution of hardware failures reported from production, service, or customers, ensuring effective corrective and preventive actions (CAPA).

---

# 2. Scope

This procedure applies to all hardware components used in products across:

- Production  
- Field Service  
- Customer Usage  

---

# 3. Responsibility

The **Hardware Team** is responsible for:

- Handling all types of hardware failures  
- Performing Root Cause Analysis (RCA)  
- Implementing Corrective and Preventive Actions (CAPA)  
- Verifying effectiveness of implemented actions  

---

# 4. Procedure

---

## 4.1 Hardware Failure Management

### Process Flow

1. Receive failure information from Production, Service, or Customers.  
2. Collect detailed failure information from Customer Success Team.  
3. Perform Root Cause Analysis (RCA).  
4. Recommend Corrective and Preventive Actions (CAPA).  
5. Verify effectiveness of implemented actions.  

### Records

- Failure Report  
- RCA Report  
- CAPA Report  

---

## 4.2 Repeated Component Failure (Post Production)

In case of repeated failures after production, the following methodology shall be followed:

---

### 4.2.1 Data Collection

- Collect failure data from customer complaints.  
- Maintain failure records with traceability:
  - Product  
  - Batch  
  - Date  
  - Location  

---

### 4.2.2 Analysis

Analyze failures based on:

- Power quality issues  
- Component mounting issues  

---

### 4.2.3 Actions

#### A. Power Quality Related Failures

- Identify voltage fluctuation, surges, spikes, improper grounding.  
- Analyze power supply conditions at customer site.  
- Recommend best practices:
  - Stabilizers  
  - Surge protection  
  - Proper earthing  
- Coordinate with Production, Service, or Customer Teams for implementation.  

---

#### B. Mounting Related Failures

- Analyze mounting methodology.  
- Review design and installation practices with Design Team.  
- Identify mechanical stress or vibration issues.  
- Propose improvements.  
- Modify clamps, fixtures, and 3D designs as required.  

### Records

- Failure Analysis Report  
- Design Review Records  
- Modification Approval Records  

---

## 4.3 Minor / Low Percentage Failures

For components with low failure rates, the following process shall be followed:

### Process

- Collect components from Production and Service Teams.  
- Perform functional testing.  
- Verify warranty status.  

### Decision Criteria

- If component meets functional requirements → Release for use.  
- If component fails functional testing:
  - Initiate warranty claim process.  
  - Record failure details.  

### Records

- Test Report  
- Warranty Claim Register  
- Traceability Record  

---

# 5. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- Failure Rate (%)  
- Repeated Failure Rate  
- CAPA Closure Time  
- Warranty Claim Success Rate
