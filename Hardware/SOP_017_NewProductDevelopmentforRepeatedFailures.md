# 1. Purpose

To define a systematic process for identifying, analyzing, and eliminating repeated component failures through new product development, ensuring reliability, quality, and compliance with applicable standards.

---

# 2. Scope

This SOP applies to all repeated component failures identified from:

- Production  
- Service  
- Customer complaints  

It covers the complete process from Root Cause Analysis (RCA) to final implementation.

---

# 3. Responsibility

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| Hardware Team | Failure analysis, component evaluation, testing, validation |
| Design Team | Design verification and technical support |
| Quality Team | RCA verification, compliance monitoring |
| Purchase Team | Sample procurement and vendor coordination |
| Management | Approval of selected solution |

---

# 4. Procedure

---

## 4.1 Identification of Repeated Failure

Collect failure data from:

- Customer complaints  
- Service reports  
- Production feedback  

Identify repeated or critical failures based on:

- Frequency  
- Severity  
- Customer impact  

---

## Step 1: Root Cause Analysis (RCA)

- Perform **5 Why Analysis** for each failure.  
- Identify the actual root cause (not symptoms).  

### Document:

- Problem statement  
- Analysis steps  
- Evidence (photos, reports, test data)  

---

## Step 2: Product Evaluation

Evaluate alternative components or solutions based on:

- Suitability for application  
- Electrical and environmental compatibility  
- Compliance with industrial standards  
- Brand reliability and past performance  
- Availability and lifecycle support  
- Cost-effectiveness  

Document evaluation comparison results.

---

## Step 3: Approval

- Submit evaluation report to Management.  
- Obtain formal approval for selected component/solution before proceeding.  

---

## Step 4: Sample Procurement

- Raise purchase request for approved components.  
- Procure samples from approved vendors.  
- Ensure full traceability of components.  

---

## Step 5: Testing

Conduct detailed testing including:

- Functional testing  
- Load and stress testing  
- Environmental testing (temperature, vibration, etc.)  
- Continuous monitoring tests with software support  

Record all test results.

---

## Step 6: Validation

Verify that the solution meets:

- Functional requirements  
- Reliability criteria  
- Environmental conditions  

Compare performance with existing components.  
Ensure no new risks are introduced.

---

## Step 7: Field Trial

- Implement the component in actual field conditions.  
- Monitor performance for **1–2 months** (based on component criticality).  

Collect data on:

- Failure rate  
- Performance stability  
- Customer feedback  

---

## Step 8: Finalization

If field trial is successful:

- Approve for full-scale implementation.  
- Update:
  - Electrical drawings  
  - BOM (Bill of Materials)  
  - Work instructions  
- Issue **Engineering Change Notice (ECN)**.  
- Communicate changes to all relevant departments.  

---

# 5. Records

Maintain the following records:

- Failure Analysis Report (RCA)  
- Component Evaluation Sheet  
- Test Reports  
- Validation Reports  
- Field Trial Report  

---

# 6. Approval
