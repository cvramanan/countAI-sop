# STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP)  
## SOP – Electrical Documentation and Control  

| Doc No | SOP-017-01 |
|--------|------------|
| Revision No | R00 |
| Revision Date | 16-02-2026 |

---

# 1. Purpose

To define a structured method for preparation, identification, review, approval, and maintenance of electrical documents to ensure traceability and compliance with **ISO 9001:2015**.

---

# 2. Scope

This SOP applies to all electrical and related engineering documents such as:

- Electrical drawings  
- Wiring diagrams  
- Mechanical assembly drawings  
- Bill of Materials (BOM)  
- Special configuration drawings (e.g., lighting variants, slip ring designs)  

---

# 3. Responsibility

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| Engineer | Prepare documents |
| Reviewer | Verify technical accuracy |
| Approver | Approve documents |
| Document Controller | Maintain document register and ensure document control |

---

# 4. Procedure

---

## 4.1 Document Categorization

All documents shall be grouped based on project or product category, such as:

- Fab I  
- CountAi  

Each group shall contain all related documents for that project.

---

## 4.2 Document Identification

Each document shall have a unique **Document Number**.

### Example Format:

- **ED** – Electrical Drawing  
- **FI** – Fab I  
- **CK** – CountAi  
- **SD** – Super Nova Double  
- **SS** – Super Nova Single  

### Example:

Each document shall include:

- Document Number  
- Document Title  
- Revision Number (R00, R01, etc.)  
- Revision Date  

---

## 4.3 Document Register Maintenance

All documents shall be recorded in a **Document Register** with the following fields:

| S.No | Name of Document | Machine Model / Specification | Start Date | End Date | Status | Document No | Revision No | Revision Date |
|------|------------------|------------------------------|------------|----------|--------|------------|-------------|--------------|

- The Document Register shall be maintained project-wise.
- The register shall be updated regularly.

---

## 4.4 Document Creation

Documents shall be created based on project requirements, including:

- Electrical drawings  
- Wiring diagrams (IR & White, Blue light configurations, etc.)  
- Mechanical assembly drawings  
- BOM documents  

Where multiple configurations exist (e.g., Mayer / Pilotelli machines or lighting variations), separate documents shall be prepared for each configuration.

---

## 4.5 Review Process

All documents shall be reviewed to ensure:

- Technical correctness  
- Correct machine model (e.g., Mayer, Pilotelli)  
- Correct configuration (IR, White, Blue light, etc.)  
- Compliance with design standards  

---

## 4.6 Approval Process

- Documents shall be approved by authorized personnel.  
- Only approved documents shall be released for use.  

---

## 4.7 Revision Control

- Each document shall have a revision number (e.g., R00).  
- Revision date shall be updated for any change.  
- All changes shall be documented.  
- Revised documents shall be re-reviewed and approved before release.  

---

## 4.8 Handling of Missing Information

If any document is incomplete (e.g., missing Document Number, Revision Number, or Date):

- It shall not be considered complete.  
- Required details must be updated before release.  

---

## 4.9 Storage and Access

- All documents shall be stored in designated **G-drive location**.  
- Data shall be organized project-wise (Fab I, CountAi, etc.).  
- Only latest revisions shall be accessible for use.  
- Obsolete documents shall be archived.  

---

# 5. Records

The following records shall be maintained:

- Electrical drawings  
- Wiring diagrams  
- Bill of Materials (BOM)  
- Document Register  
- Revision records  

---

# 6. Example (Based on Current Practice)

Typical documents include:

- Super Nova Electrical Drawing and BOM  
- Super Nova Double and Single Electrical Drawings  
- A2S Slipring Wiring Drawings (IR & White, IR & Blue, White & White)  
- Mechanical Assembly Drawings (Mayer / Pilotelli)  
- Stabilizer and Wiper Electrical Drawings  

Each document is tracked with:

- Status  
- Document Number  
- Revision Details  
- Recorded in the Document Register
