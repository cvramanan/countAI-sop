# SOP – SOP Naming Convention & Governance

## 1. Purpose
Ensure every SOP is uniquely identifiable, searchable, and scalable through a single enforced naming standard.

## 2. Scope
**Included:** All SOPs created, revised, approved, or archived across departments.  
**Excluded:** Work instructions, temporary checklists, training decks, informal notes.

## 3. Naming Standard (Mandatory)

SOP_<Department code>_<SOP name>

## 4. Department Codes (Fixed)

| 001 | Management |

No custom or ad-hoc department codes are permitted.

## 5. SOP Name Rules

- Use plain English only  
- Start with a verb  
- Describe one process only  
- No abbreviations unless universally accepted  
- No versions, dates, or personal names  

**Good Examples**
- `SOP_006_InstallTrialMachine`
- `SOP_007_CloseTrialToSale`
- `SOP_009_HandleCustomerEscalation`

**Bad Examples**
- `SOP_Sales_Trial_Process_V2`
- `Trial SOP Final`
- `SOP_006_ServiceFlow_New`

## 6. Ownership & Control

- **Accountable:** Department Head  
- **Responsible:** SOP Author  
- **Approver:** Functional Head + Quality  
- **Custodian:** Document Control  

Each SOP has one and only one owner.

## 7. Versioning Rule

- Version numbers are not part of the SOP name  
- Version control is maintained inside the document:
  - Version number
  - Effective date
  - Change summary

## 8. Storage & Access

- Central SOP repository only  
- Folder structure mirrors department codes  
- Read-only access for operators  
- Edit access limited to owners and document control

## 9. Quality Checkpoints

An SOP name is valid only if:
- Department code matches ownership  
- SOP name is verb-led and unambiguous  
- Naming format is followed exactly  
- Ownership is assigned  

Non-compliant SOPs are rejected.

## 10. Exception Handling

- Cross-functional SOPs use the primary owning department code  
- Temporary processes exceeding 30 days require SOP naming  
- Deviations require Quality Head approval

## 11. Metrics & Review Cadence

- SOP naming compliance rate  
- SOP rejection rate due to naming errors  
- Quarterly audit by Document Control

## 12. Version Control & Improvement Trigger

- Annual review or organizational restructure  
- Update triggered by department code changes or scale expansion

**Principle:**  
If a process cannot be named clearly, it is not ready to be standardized.
