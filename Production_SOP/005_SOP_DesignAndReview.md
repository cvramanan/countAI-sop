# SOP: Design & Review – Mechanical Design Team

---

## 1. Purpose
To ensure the Mechanical Design team reviews the Technical Data Sheet (TDS), finalizes the design, and releases all required engineering outputs (Assembly Drawing, BOM, Checklist, and Reports) within the defined timeline.

---

## 2. Scope
This SOP applies to the Mechanical Design team involved in reviewing TDS and releasing design documents for production.

---

## 3. Responsibility

**Design Engineer**
- Review TDS and understand machine requirements.
- Prepare and release assembly drawings, BOM, and checklist.
- Share nesting requirements and files as in mail format.

**Design Lead / Manager**
- Review and approve design outputs.
- Ensure adherence to timeline.

**Planning / Coordinator**
- Track design status and maintain records.

---

## 4. Procedure

### 4.1 TDS Review & Design Initiation
- Design team receives approved TDS from Sales/Production.
- Design engineer reviews machine specifications as prescribed in the TDS.
- Identify:
  - Machine compatibility
  - Special customer requirements
  - Modification needs (if any)
- Clarify discrepancies (if any) with Sales before proceeding.

---

### 4.2 Preliminary Design Validation
- Confirm design feasibility.
- Select standard vs. custom components.
- Freeze the design concept.

> ⏱ **Timeline:** Immediate upon TDS receipt

---

### 4.3 Nesting Requirement Submission (Mandatory First Step)

Before releasing final design documents:

- Prepare clamp and other items in nesting data.
- Send details to vendor via email.

#### 📧 Standard Mail Format – Nesting Request

**Attachments:**
- DXF / CAD files
- Any special instructions

> ✅ Nesting mail must be sent **before design release**

---

### 4.4 Detailed Design Release to Production Team

Design engineer shall prepare and release:

#### Required Outputs

- ✅ Assembly Drawing (Assy)
- ✅ Bill of Materials (BOM)
- ✅ Design Checklist
- ✅ Any supporting calculation/report (if applicable)

---

### 4.5 Internal Design Review

- Design Lead reviews:
  - Sheetmetal Items Confirmations
  - BOM completeness
  - Standard compliance
  - Manufacturability
- Corrections (if any) to be closed before release.

> ✅ No document shall be released without review approval.

---

### 4.6 Design Finalization Timeline

| Machine Type | Maximum Design Time |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Standard Machine | **1 Working Day** |
| Critical Machine | **2 Working Days** |

> ⏱ Timeline starts from **complete TDS receipt**

---

### 4.7 Document Release to Production

After approval:

- Upload final documents to project folder.
- Inform Production and Planning via email.
- Ensure correct revision naming.

---

### 4.8 Record Keeping & Version Control

- Maintain all design files in project folder.
- Follow revision control practice.
- Any design change must follow formal ECN/ECR process.

---

## 5. Design Checklist (Quick Reference)

Before release, confirm:

- [ ] TDS reviewed completely  
- [ ] Machine compatibility checked  
- [ ] Nesting mail sent  
- [ ] Assembly drawing completed  
- [ ] BOM verified  
- [ ] Design checklist completed  
- [ ] Design review approved  
- [ ] Files uploaded and shared  

---

## 6. Escalation

Escalate to Design Lead if:

- TDS information is incomplete
- Custom design exceeds timeline
- Technical feasibility issues arise
- Critical machine identified

---

**Document Control**
- Version: 1.0  
- Effective Date: _DD-MM-YYYY_  
- Prepared By: _Name_  
- Approved By: _Name_
