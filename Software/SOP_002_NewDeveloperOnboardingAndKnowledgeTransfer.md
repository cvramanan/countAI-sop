# SOP_002_NEW DEVELOPER ONBOARDING & KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER
**Version:** 1.0  
**Owner:** Project Manager  
**Applies To:** All Engineering Hires (Full-time / Contract / Intern)

---

## 1. Purpose
This SOP ensures:

- Zero chaos onboarding  
- Controlled & traceable system access  
- Fast productivity (reduce *Time to First PR*)  
- Structured Knowledge Transfer (KT)  
- Security & compliance alignment  
- Clear ownership & accountability  

**Goal: A new developer should:**

- Push their first PR within 5 working days  
- Fully understand product architecture within 2 weeks  
- Work independently within 30 days  

---

## 2. Guiding Principles

- Access is role-based, not person-based  
- No undocumented knowledge transfer  
- No production access without formal approval  
- Onboarding is a measurable engineering process  
- Every new hire must produce output within Week 1  

---

## 3. Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|--------------|
| HR | Initiates onboarding request |
| PM | Confirms business requirement & roadmap alignment |
| Tech Lead | Defines technical scope, access level & KT plan |
| DevOps | Provisions infrastructure access |
| Buddy | Day-to-day onboarding support |
| Engineering Head | Final accountability |

---

## 4. Onboarding Timeline (Real-World Execution Plan)

### 🔹 T-3 Days (Before Joining)

**HR**
- Create onboarding request (L2 priority)
- Upload offer details + joining date

**PM**
- Confirm assigned product/module
- Define first 30-day goals

**Tech Lead**
- Define access matrix
- Assign buddy
- Prepare starter task

---

### 🔹 Day 1 – System Readiness & Orientation

**DevOps must provision:**
- Email ID
- Git access (restricted branch policy)
- Project management tool access
- Staging environment access
- Documentation access
- Slack / Communication tools
- Code review permissions (read-only initially)

**Mandatory Day 1 Activities:**
- Architecture overview session (1.5 hrs)
- Repo walkthrough
- Coding standards explanation
- Deployment flow explanation
- Security best practices overview

**Output:**
- Access log entry updated
- Onboarding checklist signed

---

### 🔹 Day 2–3 – Structured KT

KT must be documented and recorded.

**KT Topics:**
- Product overview
- System architecture
- Code structure
- Database schema
- API flow
- CI/CD pipeline
- Error handling & logging
- Current tech debt
- Ongoing sprint context

**KT Method:**
- Screen sharing
- Architecture diagrams
- Q&A session
- Recorded session stored in drive

**Deliverable:**
- KT Completion Sheet (signed by Buddy)
- Developer must explain architecture back *(Reverse KT validation)*

---

### 🔹 Day 4–5 – Starter Task Execution

Starter task must:
- Be small but real
- Touch actual codebase
- Include code review process

**Examples:**
- Minor feature enhancement
- Bug fix
- Refactor small module
- Improve logging
- Add unit tests

**Success Criteria:**
- First PR raised
- PR reviewed by Tech Lead
- Feedback implemented

---

## 5. Approval & Access Governance

### Access Control Levels

| Level | Access Type | Approval |
|-------|------------|----------|
| L1 | Documentation only | PM |
| L2 | Codebase (non-production) | Tech Lead |
| L3 | Staging deployment | Tech Lead + DevOps |
| L4 | Production access | Engineering Head + DevOps |

⚠ **Production access only after 30 days unless exception approved**

---

## 6. Knowledge Transfer (KT) Sign-Off

KT is complete only when:

- Buddy confirms active participation
- Tech Lead validates technical understanding
- Developer explains:
  - System architecture
  - Deployment flow
  - Debugging method
  - Branching strategy

**Formal Sign-Off Flow:**

Buddy → Tech Lead → Engineering Head *(recorded in KT sheet)*

---

## 7. Deliverables Checklist

- ✅ Access Log  
- ✅ Onboarding Checklist  
- ✅ KT Completion Sheet  
- ✅ First PR  
- ✅ Code Review Feedback Log  
- ✅ 30-Day Plan Document  

---

## 8. Performance Metrics (Audit KPIs)

| KPI | Target |
|-----|--------|
| Access Provision Time | < 24 hours |
| Time to First PR | ≤ 5 days |
| KT Completion Rate | 100% |
| 30-Day Productivity Score | ≥ 80% |
| First PR Rework Rate | < 20% |

These KPIs are reviewed monthly by Engineering Head.

---

## 9. Escalation Matrix

| Issue | Escalation To | SLA |
|-------|--------------|-----|
| Access delay > 24 hrs | PM → DevOps | Immediate |
| No starter task assigned | Tech Lead | Same day |
| KT not scheduled | PM | 24 hrs |
| Poor onboarding experience | Engineering Head | Immediate |

---

## 10. Risk Management

**Common Failures & Prevention**

- Developer idle for first week  
  → Assign starter task before joining  

- KT done but not understood  
  → Implement Reverse KT validation  

- Too much access given  
  → Use role-based access matrix  

- Knowledge silo  
  → Record all KT sessions  

---

## 11. 30-Day Success Framework

**Week 1**
- Understand architecture
- Raise first PR

**Week 2**
- Deliver small feature independently

**Week 3**
- Participate in sprint planning
- Review at least 1 PR

**Week 4**
- Own a module-level task

---

## 12. Continuous Improvement

After 30 days:

- Conduct onboarding feedback survey
- Identify friction points
- Update SOP quarterly
- Track onboarding trend metrics
