## 2. Scope

This SOP applies whenever the Software Team PM requires support from:

- DevOps  
- QA  
- UI/UX  
- Data Team  
- Infrastructure  
- Security  
- Finance  
- HR  
- Any other internal team  

---

## 3. Core Principles

- Respect others' priorities  
- Provide complete context  
- Be outcome-oriented  
- Set clear and realistic deadlines  
- Follow up professionally  

---

## 4. Pre-Request Checklist

Before reaching out, ensure the following:

- [ ] Requirement is clearly documented  
- [ ] Business impact is defined  
- [ ] Required output is clearly mentioned  
- [ ] Deadline is realistic  
- [ ] Relevant stakeholders are identified  

---

## 5. Mandatory Information Format (Support Request Template)

**Subject:** `[Project Name] – Support Required – [Short Description]`

### 1. Background
Short context of the project and why support is needed.

### 2. Objective
What exact outcome is expected?

### 3. Scope of Work

- Task 2  
- Task 3  

### 4. Business Impact
Why does this matter?  
What happens if delayed?

### 5. Timeline
- Start Date:
- Expected Completion Date:

### 6. Dependencies

## 6. Communication Channels

| Request Size | Communication Mode |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Small Request | Slack / Teams (with written summary) |
| Medium Request | Email with documentation link |
| Large / Critical Request | Meeting + Email Summary + Jira Ticket |

---

## 7. Escalation Path

**Step 1:** Gentle reminder after agreed timeline.  
**Step 2:** Discuss blockers directly with team lead.  
**Step 3:** Escalate to respective manager with facts (no blame, only data).  

---

## 8. Follow-Up SOP

- Track all requests in a shared tracker (Jira / Excel / Notion).  
- Send a reminder 1 day before the deadline.  
- Update stakeholders once completed.  
- Close the request formally in writing.  

---

## 9. Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Vague or unclear requests  
- Last-minute urgency without justification  
- No written documentation  
- Emotional escalation  
- Not respecting the other team’s workload  

---

## 10. KPIs to Measure Effectiveness

- Average turnaround time  
- Number of clarification cycles  
- Missed deadline percentage  
- Stakeholder satisfaction feedback  

---

## 11. Continuous Improvement

- Review cross-team friction points quarterly.  
- Identify recurring blockers.  
- Refine the request format or process accordingly.  
- Improve clarity, documentation, and alignment standards over time.
