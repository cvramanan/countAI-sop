**Doc Name:** KNITI-SOP-QC-00  
**Company:** COUNTAI  
**Revision No:** R01  
**Revision Date:** 16/02/2026  

---

## 1. Objective

To ensure consistent hardware quality, operational reliability, and fast issue resolution across the entire product lifecycle — from inward material receipt to post-installation support — by implementing standardized Quality Control processes.

---

## 2. Quality Objectives

- Prevent field failures and repeat issues  
- Ensure software–hardware compatibility  
- Reduce dispatch rejections and site downtime  
- Protect customer confidence and brand reputation  

---

## 3. Process Flow map

Material Receipt → Inspection → Assembly Checking → Software Installation
→ Cabinet Testing → Approval → Dispatch
→ Installation Verification → Support & Issue Tracking
---

## 4. Scope of Quality Control

This SOP covers the full lifecycle of hardware and software:

- Inward Material Inspection  
- Assembly GA Check & Wire Pull Test  
- Software Installation  
- Cabinet Testing and Report Approval  
- Installation Verification  
- Mill Return – All Items Check & Testing  
- Post-Installation Hardware Ticket Support  

---

## 5. Key Control Steps

### Step 1: Inward Material Inspection

- Physical and specification verification  
- Early rejection of defective materials  

---

### Step 2: Assembly & Integration

- Controlled mechanical checks  
- Electrical continuity testing  
- Component compatibility checks  

---

### Step 3: Software Installation

**Activities:**

- Install & configure Tab Monitor 5 application  
- OS installation, partitioning, and script execution on:
  - 256 GB SD Card  
  - 512 GB SD Card  

---

### Step 4: Cabinet Testing and Report

After complete assembly and software installation:

- Functional testing of the fully assembled cabinet  
- Verification of:
  - Electrical functionality  
  - Mechanical stability  
  - Software performance  

- Test results documented in a **Cabinet Test Report**  
- QC review and approval mandatory before dispatch  

---

### Step 5: Installation Verification

- On-site validation of mounting  
- Power verification  
- Connectivity validation  

---

### Step 6: Mill Return – All Items Check & Testing

- Motherboard full functionality test  
- Camera, sensor, and controller checks  
- Power SMPS load and safety testing  

---

### Step 7: Post-Installation Hardware Ticket Support

- Structured ticket logging and tracking  
- Root cause analysis before closure  
- Corrective and preventive action documentation  

---

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

- No physical damage or loose connections  
- Electrical parameters within specified limits  
- Stable software and hardware operation under load  
- Successful completion of all defined tests  

---

## 7. Records & Documentation

The following records shall be maintained to ensure traceability, accountability, and quality compliance:

- Cabinet Inspection Documents for each individual system  
- Packing Reports (linked to system serial numbers)  
- Daily Failure Log (daily hardware failures)  
- Hardware Issue Log (issue details and corrective actions)  
- Material Receiving Inspection Report (MRIR) for all incoming materials  

---

## 8. Conclusion

This SOP defines the standard process to ensure quality and reliability of hardware and software systems at every stage.  

Following this SOP helps prevent failures, reduce rework, and ensure smooth installation and operation at customer sites.  

All teams must follow these procedures to maintain consistent quality and meet organizational standards.
