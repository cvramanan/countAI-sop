# Escalation Management SOP
**Role:** Technical Support Engineer  
**Department:** Technical Support  
**Version:** 1.0  

---

## 1. Purpose
The purpose of this SOP is to define a structured and controlled escalation process to ensure timely resolution of issues that cannot be resolved at the initial support level.

This SOP ensures clear ownership, minimal delays, and effective coordination between Technical Support, Software, and Hardware teams.

---

## 2. Scope
This SOP applies to:

- All support tickets requiring escalation
- Software-related escalations
- Hardware-related escalations
- Business-critical escalations

This SOP does not cover initial issue intake or troubleshooting steps.

---

## 3. Escalation Levels

| Level | Team | Responsibility |
|------|------|----------------|
| L1 | Technical Support Engineer | Initial analysis & troubleshooting |
| L2 | Software / Hardware Team | Deep technical investigation |
| L3 | Engineering Lead / Manager | Critical decisions & prioritization |

---

## 4. Criteria for Escalation
A ticket must be escalated when one or more of the following conditions are met:

- Issue is beyond L1 troubleshooting capability
- Root cause identified as software bug or hardware failure
- Repeated occurrence of the same issue
- Business-critical or production-down issue
- Security or data-impacting issue

---

## 5. Escalation Types

### 5.1 Software Escalation
Escalate to Software Team when:

- Application crashes or backend failures occur
- AI model behavior is incorrect or inconsistent
- API or integration failures exist
- No workaround is available

### 5.2 Hardware Escalation
Escalate to Hardware Team when:

- Device is not powering on
- Sensor or component failure is confirmed
- Physical damage is identified
- Hardware diagnostics fail

### 5.3 Management Escalation
Escalate to Engineering Manager or Support Lead when:

- P1 / P2 issues occur
- SLA breach is imminent
- Customer impact is high
- Cross-team dependency delays resolution

---

## 6. Escalation Procedure

### Step 1: Confirm Escalation Need
- Complete all L1 troubleshooting steps
- Ensure issue cannot be resolved at L1
- Verify escalation criteria is met

### Step 2: Prepare Escalation Documentation
Before escalation, ensure the ticket contains:

- Clear issue summary
- Steps to reproduce
- Logs, screenshots, or diagnostic reports
- Environment and version details
- Troubleshooting steps already performed

**Incomplete tickets must not be escalated.**

### Step 3: Assign to Appropriate Team
- Update ticket category (Software / Hardware / Validation)
- Assign ticket to correct L2 team
- Set correct priority and SLA

### Step 4: Notify the Escalation Team
- Notify through ticketing system
- For P1 issues, also inform via official communication channel (Email / Jira / Message)
- Mention ticket ID and impact clearly

### Step 5: Track Escalated Ticket
- Monitor ticket progress regularly
- Follow up if no response within SLA
- Provide additional information if requested

---

## 7. Customer Communication During Escalation
- Inform customer about escalation
- Provide realistic timelines
- Share regular updates
- Avoid internal team details

**Example:**
> “Your issue has been escalated to our engineering team for further investigation.  
> We will keep you informed of progress.”

---

## 8. Priority Handling

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| P1 | Immediate escalation + management notification |
| P2 | Escalate within defined SLA |
| P3 | Escalate after L1 confirmation |
| P4 | Escalate if required |

---

## 9. Ownership During Escalation
- L1 Support remains ticket owner
- L2 teams provide technical resolution
- L1 communicates updates to customer

---

## 10. Escalation Closure Process
Once resolution is provided by L2/L3:

1. Validate fix or solution
2. Confirm with customer
3. Update resolution notes
4. Close ticket or move to monitoring

---

## 11. Escalation Quality Guidelines
- Do not escalate without proper analysis
- Avoid duplicate escalations
- Ensure professional and clear communication
- Maintain audit-ready documentation

---

## 12. Exceptions
- For major outages, escalation may occur immediately with available information
- Emergency escalations can bypass standard timelines with manager approval

---

## 13. Review & Continuous Improvement
- Review escalations monthly
- Identify frequent escalation causes
- Improve L1 troubleshooting and knowledge base

---

## ✅ Outcome of This SOP
- Faster resolution of complex issues
- Clear accountability
- Reduced SLA breaches
- Improved customer satisfaction
