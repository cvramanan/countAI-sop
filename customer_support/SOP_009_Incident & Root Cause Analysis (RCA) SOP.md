# Incident & Root Cause Analysis (RCA) SOP
**Role:** Technical Support Engineer  
**Department:** Technical Support  
**Version:** 1.0  

---

## 1. Purpose
The purpose of this SOP is to define a structured process for incident management and root cause analysis (RCA) to minimize service disruption, identify underlying causes, and prevent recurrence.

---

## 2. Scope
This SOP applies to:

- Production incidents
- Major service outages
- P1 and P2 support tickets
- Repeated or high-impact issues

This SOP covers incident detection, response, investigation, RCA, and corrective actions.

---

## 3. Definitions

### Incident
An unplanned interruption or degradation of a service that impacts customers or internal operations.

### Root Cause Analysis (RCA)
A structured investigation process to identify the underlying cause of an incident, not just the symptoms.

---

## 4. Roles & Responsibilities

### Technical Support Engineer (L1)
- Identify and log incidents
- Perform initial assessment
- Escalate incidents as required
- Support RCA data collection

### Software / Hardware Teams (L2)
- Perform deep technical investigation
- Identify root cause
- Propose corrective and preventive actions

### Incident Manager / Support Lead
- Coordinate incident response
- Approve RCA report
- Ensure follow-up actions are completed

---

## 5. Incident Classification

| Priority | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| P1 | Complete service outage / critical business impact |
| P2 | Partial service degradation |
| P3 | Minor issue |
| P4 | Informational |

---

## 6. Incident Management Process

### Step 1: Incident Detection & Logging
- Detect via customer reports, monitoring alerts, or internal teams
- Create an incident ticket immediately
- Assign priority and impact

### Step 2: Initial Response & Containment
- Acknowledge the incident
- Perform immediate actions to reduce impact
- Escalate to appropriate teams
- Communicate status internally and to customers

### Step 3: Incident Investigation
- Collect logs, metrics, alerts, and timelines
- Identify affected components
- Document actions taken during the incident

### Step 4: Incident Resolution
- Apply fix or workaround
- Validate service restoration
- Monitor system stability

---

## 7. Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Process

### 7.1 When RCA Is Required
RCA is mandatory for:

- P1 incidents
- Repeated P2 incidents
- Security-related incidents
- Customer escalation incidents

### 7.2 RCA Investigation Steps
1. Define the problem clearly
2. Establish incident timeline
3. Identify contributing factors
4. Determine the root cause
5. Validate root cause with evidence

### 7.3 RCA Techniques (Optional)
- 5 Whys
- Fishbone (Ishikawa) Diagram
- Fault Tree Analysis

---

## 8. RCA Documentation Requirements
Each RCA report must include:

- Incident summary
- Impact assessment
- Timeline of events
- Root cause description
- Corrective actions taken
- Preventive measures
- Owner and target dates

---

## 9. Communication During Incidents
- Provide regular updates to stakeholders
- Avoid speculation
- Share only verified information

---

## 10. Post-Incident Review
- Conduct a post-incident review meeting
- Review RCA findings
- Assign action items
- Track completion

---

## 11. Preventive & Corrective Actions
- Code fixes
- Configuration changes
- Monitoring improvements
- Process updates
- Training requirements

---

## 12. Incident Closure
An incident can be closed only after:

- RCA is completed and approved
- Corrective actions are documented
- Preventive actions are planned

---

## 13. Metrics & Reporting
Track:

- Number of incidents
- Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR)
- Recurrence rate
- SLA compliance

---

## 14. Review & Continuous Improvement
- Review incident trends regularly
- Update SOP and procedures
- Improve monitoring and alerting

---

## ✅ Outcome of This SOP
- Faster incident response
- Clear root cause identification
- Reduced incident recurrence
- Improved system reliability
